#   Intended use:
#     Variation of ICEBEAR Defaults (default.yml) currently implemented in the data processing
#     Used in conjuction with level1_script.py and level2_script.py
#
#   The following attributes are set automatically for posterity:
#     - date_created: automatically added by referencing the current time from time.time()
#     - version: automatically added by referencing version number of installed package
